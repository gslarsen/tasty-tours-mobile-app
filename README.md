# tasty-tours

A fullstack mobile app of Food Tasting Tours 
curated by local city guides, created as a capstone project for Project Shift in Durham, NC.

For viewing on actual device:
1. Download the 'expo client' from the applicable store for the phone

2. From the root/client directory run 'npm start' to generate a url with a QR code that can be scanned (android) or placed
  in camera view (ios), then open in the expo client

Alternative approach for android devices only: 

Head to: https://expo.io/@glarsen/tasty-tours, where you can download the expo client and then scan the QR code.
